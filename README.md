# FilmAlley_ReactJS
A React JS and Node.js full stack website that shows searched movies using results from REST API (OMDb).

This web application is inspired loosely by Filmpire and is built using React JS for front-end and back-end and executed using Node.js. The application utilizes REST API and OMDb API to retrieve movie data and movie posters.  
The application's landing page shows a search bar and a default display of selected movies. When a user searches for a movie or TV show and clicks on the search icon, the results are displayed below. Hovering over the results' posters shows additional details like the date the movie was released or the running years of the TV show. When a valid search is not made, an error message displays that no movies were found. 

Important Tools:
- React JS
- Node.js
- RESTful API
- JSX

Feature summary: 
- search movies and TV shows

Future features implementation:
- allow users to click on movies to view additional details
